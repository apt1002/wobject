# WObject

An experiment in implementing a high-level language on top of a low-level
language. The low-level language is untyped Lambda Calculus with atoms and
hashtables from atoms. The high-level language has macros, functions, a static
type system, and objects.

This is not meant to be a realistic language. For example, it has no numbers
or arithmetic. The experiment focuses on the relationship of the two languages.
